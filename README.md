### Festival Text
The community of designers, artists, students, and professors are all 足invited to the design festival Improvise, Adapt and Overcome.

As designers, thinkers, and makers we must become greater than we have been. The times of crisis that we live in calls for people to be extra bold, open minded, and larger in outlook. We must become a community of designers that overcomes. The design festival, improvise, adapt and overcome brings together speakers from various disciplines to advise, coach, and share their experiences on how they Improvise adapt and overcome.

Historical periods of conflict have undoubtedly helped impact and inspire designers and visual 足communicators.

The historical events of the 20th-century changed the world in unexpected ways. During the modern century, art and design were influenced by the political problems of the 20th century. Modernism and Art Deco were a direct response to the evident terrors of the First World War. Modern artists also responded to the end of World War II and the fear of the Cold War tensions.

Today, we are remarkably in times of Crisis. From the considerable rise of humanitarian needs to the gentle stirs and conflicts of civil war, along with the fight for diversity: equality: social justice, as well as the COVID 19 virus. Coronavirus has swept through every nation and has killed over a million people worldwide. Coronavirus has economically taken away millions of people's jobs due to lockdowns and restrictions. Local businesses, as well as major corporations, have also suffered losses.

In times like this, adaptability and considerable flexibility are some keys to making a change. As 足creative designers, thinkers, and makers, we must become considerably greater than we have realistically been. The ongoing crisis that we live in calls for willing people to be courageous, open-minded, imaginative, intelligent, productive, and future-driven. We must voluntarily become a community of 足designers that overcome. The design festival, Improvise Adapt and Overcome brings together speakers fashion designer Nina Jaun, industrial designer Holger Bramsiepe, and design researcher Lola Conte to advise, explain, and reveal their personal experiences on how they tackle the modern crisis of today.
