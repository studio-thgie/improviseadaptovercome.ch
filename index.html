                <p>The community of designers, artists, students, and professors are all ­invited to the design festival
                    Improvise, Adapt and Overcome.</p>
                <p>As designers, thinkers, and makers we must become greater than we have been. The times of crisis that
                    we live in calls for people to be extra bold, open minded, and larger in outlook. We must become a
                    community of designers that overcomes. The design festival, improvise, adapt and overcome brings
                    together speakers from various disciplines to advise, coach, and share their experiences on how they
                    Improvise adapt and overcome.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Historical periods of conflict have undoubtedly helped impact and inspire designers and visual
                    ­communicators. </p>

                <p>The historical events of the 20th-century changed the world in unexpected ways. During the modern
                    century, art and design were influenced by the political problems of the 20th century. Modernism and
                    Art Deco were a direct response to the evident terrors of the First World War. Modern artists also
                    responded to the end of World War II and the fear of the Cold War tensions. </p>

                <p>Today, we are remarkably in times of Crisis. From the considerable rise of humanitarian needs to the
                    gentle stirs and conflicts of civil war, along with the fight for diversity: equality: social
                    justice, as well as the COVID 19 virus. Coronavirus has swept through every nation and has killed
                    over a million people worldwide. Coronavirus has economically taken away millions of people's jobs
                    due to lockdowns and restrictions. Local businesses, as well as major corporations, have also
                    suffered losses. </p>

                <p>In times like this, adaptability and considerable flexibility are some keys to making a change. As
                    ­creative designers, thinkers, and makers, we must become considerably greater than we have
                    realistically been. The ongoing crisis that we live in calls for willing people to be courageous,
                    open-minded, imaginative, intelligent, productive, and future-driven. We must voluntarily become a
                    community of ­designers that overcome. The design festival, Improvise Adapt and Overcome brings
                    together speakers fashion designer Nina Jaun, industrial designer Holger Bramsiepe, and design
                    researcher Lola Conte to advise, explain, and reveal their personal experiences on how they tackle
                    the modern crisis of today. </p>
